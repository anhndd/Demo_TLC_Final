# tlc_thesis_final_v1

# Dates: 12h16 27/04/2019

1. Old reward
2. New action for 4 phase 10s 10s 10s 10s
3. Implement Target network
4. Simple simulation includes 1 vehicle type (4 simulation NS WE HIGH LOW).
5. State 60*60*1 for position (Duy's implementation)
6. Model by Keras
7. Dueling, double, prioritized,..: NOT YET IMPLEMENT

# TARGET 
1. GOOD
2. GOOD
3. Verify it?
4.  + Transform to To Hien Thanh Simulation 
    + 4 silumation: WE NS HIGH LOW
5. State: 60*60*2 (DA's implementation)
6. GOOD
7. Implement it and verify.
