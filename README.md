# Demo_TLC_Final

This Research project is about using Deep Reinforcement Learning to control traffic light. 

<h2>Goal:</h2> 
  • Be able to make decisions that help navigate vehicles effectively, reduce waiting times and traffic congestion. 
  • Flexible, well-functioning models In unusual situations, it is possible to expand to complex intersections (5-way intersection, 6-way intersection, roundabout, etc.).
  • The evaluation and verification must yield the best results when compared to the common traffic light system, with other models.

<h2>Content:</h2>
  • Build simulation using SUMO tool.
  • Apply Keras library to implement Deep neuron network.
  • Contain solution optimize model train in fork & crossroads, presentation, thesis report.
